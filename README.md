## Classification of Adverse Events
The files in this ptojct presents the code for the best performing Multinominal Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine models, as presented in the thesis. 

As presented in the thesis several combinations of preprocessing have been tested to acheive the best results. 

### Stopword removal
When applying stopword removal and not Stemming, the stopword removal have been achieved using the stop_words parameter in the vectorizers. (skriv hvor vi har stopordlisten fra)
When applying stopword removal and stemming the stopwords are removed before stemming. It is then done as follows:
